Medical linear accelerators (LINACs) are machines that use electron beams to deliver ionizing radiation to treat tumours and other medical conditions.
LinacSimPy is an interactive model of a linac meant for use in educational programs for medical physicists, radiation therapists and service personnel.
It simulates how the operating parameters of a linac affect measurable properties of the output beam such as dose rate, symmetry, and uniformity.

# Running LinacSimPy
LinacSimPy is supplied as Python source code to ensure it is compact, portable and can be modified. Despite not being an executable, it's *very easy* to install and should run on anything that can run Python.

The basic capabilities of LinacSimPy are described in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l84XlGtHGhk).

## Requirements
LinacSimPy requires Python 3.* and has been tested under both Windows and Linux. It uses several standard packages that are listed in `requirements.txt`.
Unless you are using Python for other work and need additional functionality, the installers from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/) are sufficient.
You must ensure that all the required packages are present by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or the equivalent command for your Python distribution (e.g., Conda in Anaconda).

## Installation
Download the archive as a `zip file` (**Code > Download Zip** in the menu above or click [here](https://github.com/dezanche/LinacSimPy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) and extract it to a suitable (empty) directory on your machine. You can also use the `git clone` command if you have `git` installed on your system.


## Usage
From the command line prompt (`CMD` terminal in Windows) `cd` to the directory where you saved the LinacSimPy archive. On a correctly-configured system executing `python LinacSimPyMain.py` (or `python3...`) from the command line should launch the program and display the main window. The first time you do this may take a few seconds while Python creates the `*.pyc` files.

If the system cannot find Python in its search `path` you'll get an error (or Windows launches the Microsoft Store app). There are many guides online on how to fix this by adding Python to your `path`. Alternatively you can specify the complete path to the Python executable like this example on Windows:

```>C:\Program Files\Python310\python LinacSimPyMain.py```

# Version History

## Credits
LinacSimPy is based on SIMAC version 3.4, by Marco Carlone, Miller MacPherson, Rhys Anderson, Michael Lamey, and Kevin Wang.\
Theory and technical details of SIMAC were published in [JACMP, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1120%2Fjacmp.v16i3.5139).

## Changelog
This is a brief summary of the changes made to obtain LinacSimPy:
- ported PyQt4 calls to corresponding calls in PyQt5
- various fixes to update from Python 2.7 to 3.10, to matplotlib 3.10.0
- added tooltips to buttons
- added keyboard shortcuts to common operations
- toggle color (red, green) of beam on/off button depending on state
- added confirmation dialog before closing
- added splash screen at startup
- added information message when calculating without beam on and energy selected (idle)
- turning off linac no longer resets energy and values
- replaced copyrighted images with cc-by versions and added tooltips to original file when hovering over
- changed name to LinacSimPy
- layout changes to accommodate longer labels for clarity
- changed `us` to use the proper micro symbol, i.e., $\mu$

## Known Issues
- windows and items inside are not resizable
- input and output quantities are not grouped clearly in the main window
- general layout of the main window can be improved
- input values can be entered only using the sliders, not with the text boxes
- cannot reset to default state without restarting 
- grid voltage control is disabled
- some operations in the File menu cause a crash
