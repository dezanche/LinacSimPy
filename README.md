# LinacSimPy
Medical linear accelerators (LINACs) are machines that deliver doses of ionizing radiation to treat tumours and other medical conditions.
LinacSimPy is an interactive model of a linac for educational purposes. It simulates how the operating parameters of a linac affect measurable properties of the output beam such as dose rate, symmetry, and uniformity.
Typical users of LinacSimPy include teaching programs for medical physicists, radiation therapists and service personnel.

# Running CoSymPy
CoSymPy is supplied as source code to ensure it's portable. Despite not being an executable, it's *very easy* to install and run on anything that can run Python.

## Requirements
CoSymPy requires Python 3.* and has been tested under both Windows and Linux. It uses several standard packages that are listed in `requirements.txt`.
Unless you are using Python for other work and need additional functionality, the installers from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/) are sufficient.
You must ensure that all the required packages are present by running `pip install requirements.txt` or the equivalent command for your Python distribution (e.g., Anaconda).

## Installation
Download the archive and extract the resulting `zip file` to a suitable (empty) directory on your machine. You can also use the `git clone` command if you have `git` installed on your system.


## Usage
From the command line (`CMD` terminal in Windows) `cd` to the directory where you saved the LinacSimPy archive. On a correctly-configured system running `Python LinacSimPy.py` should launch the program and display the main window. The first time you do this may take a few seconds while python creates the `*.pyc` files.
