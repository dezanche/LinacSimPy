# LinacSimPy
Medical linear accelerators (LINACs) are machines that deliver doses of radiation to treat tumours and other medical conditions.
LinacSimPy is an interactive model of a linac for educational purposes. It teaches medical physics students how the operating parameters of a linac affect the properties of the output beam.
